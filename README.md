## 👋 Welcome to the Movement

This is the **open-source HQ** of *Digital Assembly of People* — a non-profit civic platform where devs, designers, activists, and everyday citizens come together to **code democracy into existence**.

We’re using **GitHub Discussions** as our public square:

* 🧠 Ask questions about tech, features, or governance  
* 💡 Share ideas for new tools or platform improvements  
* 🤝 Collaborate on civic-first digital solutions  
* 🔧 Contribute your skills — coding or not  

> 🧘‍♂️This isn’t just a project. It’s a digital jan sabha.

## 🧭 What’s the Project About?

**Digital Assembly of People** is a community-run, privacy-first platform that gives citizens tools to:

* Post and debate anonymously  
* File and track RTI responses  
* Hold politicians accountable  
* Share verified corruption exposés  
* Engage in civic action, minus the noise and ads  

> Imagine if **Reddit**, **MyGov**, and **RTI.gov** had a privacy-obsessed, open-source baby — that’s us.

* 💵 Funded entirely by public donations (UPI, crypto, crowdfunding)  
* 🧾 Fully transparent with expenses and updates
